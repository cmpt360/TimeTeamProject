Code Practices

1. Every method requires a comment block. Tricky code should have some short comments to help us understand whats going on.

2. Proper white spacing. It doesn't have to be uniform. Just spaced and legible.

3. Use MonoDevelop Flags:
	TODO: If code is not done or unfinished, mark TODO in the comment.
	FIXME: If code is implemented but buggy or broken, mark FIXME in a comment near that code.
	HACK: If code is implemented but you know this isn't the way to do it, mark it HACK.
	
	Explain each flag, with the exception of TODO near an empty method which should be obvious.
	
Git Hub

No folders other then those present, no folders for your own version of the project. If you need your own version please look at branching:
https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/

The branch main is for commits and review by us and the professor. Branching should be kept to a minimum. 

I'll add a short Git cheat sheet in the next day or two. If on Windows or Mac feel free to use the Git Desktop.
